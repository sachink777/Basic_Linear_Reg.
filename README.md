Residual :

A residual is the difference between an observed value and a predicted value in regression analysis.

          Residual = observed y â€“ predicted y
     
By applying the linear regression on dataset main motive of user should be find the value of m (slope) and c (intercept) where residual must be minimum or zero.

Use of residual -- There are several uses for residuals. One use is to help us to determine if we have a data set that has an overall linear trend, or if we should consider a different model. The reason for this is that residuals help to amplify any nonlinear pattern in our data. What can be difficult to see by looking at a scatterplot can be more easily observed by examining the residuals, and a corresponding residual plot.
